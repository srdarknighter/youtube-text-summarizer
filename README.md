# youtube-text-summarizer

A brief about the steps followed:

1. Used the pegasus trained on the cnn dataset as the base model
2. Fine tuned it with samsum dataset, this consists of dialogue and its corresponding summary
3. Made a streamlit_app.py + requirements.txt file for a streamlit instance
4. Faced some issues when hosting it with streamlit (trying to resolve it)

Logs also didnt provide any comments on the error faced
